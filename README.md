# C - Simple Shell

The simple shell is a project by alx- SE program.

The simple shell is meant to demonstrate the working of the linux shell
or terminal.

The shell basically has two modes of interaction:
-Interactive mode
-Non interactive mode.

In this two modes, there is a similar implementation of the different aspects of the shell.

The most important of all this is that the shell basically runs under an infinite loop
that can only be terminated when the user manually terminates it meaning inorder to create
a linux shell, you must make sure that the shell prompt is under an infinite loop inorder to
keep accepting commands.

The linux terminators are:
-the exit command
-Ctr + C or Ctr +D
